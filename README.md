        <h2>Poem</h2>
        <p>When I consider how my light is spent,</p>
        <p>Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,</p>
        <p>And that one Talent which is death to hide,</p>
        <p>Locked up to use, and ever minding what I owe</p>
        <p>To my Creator, that in me, O Lord,</p>
        <p>Show me how to serve thee with my abilities,</p>
        <p>Let me not waste my days by living in idle ways.</p>
